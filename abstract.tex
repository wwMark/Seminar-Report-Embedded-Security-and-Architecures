Meta reinforcement learning is a research area that combines reinforcement learning and meta learning. It applies meta learning approaches on reinforcement learning tasks to generalize the training result of reinforcement learning and adapts it to unseen tasks. In this report, we firstly provide some fundamental knowledges about meta reinforcement learning. Then we discuss a couple of algorithms in detail and analyse their experimental results.\par
